                        <p>Promoting growth and development through competitive soccer in Queens, New York.
                             Eastern Queens F.C. was founded in 2016 by Jonathan and Jimmy Puma. They grew
                              up playing travel soccer throughout their childhood, but had to travel over an 
                              hour out of Queens just to be able to compete at the highest level. Soon they
                               realized, they arenâ€™t the only people from Queens who were forced to travel 
                               outside of the borough in order to play competitive and organized soccer. With
                                so much passion and talent produced in Queens, it was time for a club to reflect
                                 that determination and dedication. Eastern Queens F.C. aims to bring that same 
                                 level of elite competition to the people of Queens.
