# Soccer-site
 
 This is a web page, for Eastern Queens Football Club. I played soccer growing up and there was a specific tournament I played in that would always update 
 their schedule every Thursday and I remember alway looking forward to it because the only thing I was able to really do at that age was go online and search something up.
 It was also very easy and effiecient to pull up the schedule for my parents. That way they knew where I would be and around what time, without them actually wondering where I could be. My friend Jimmy and I have grown up playing together and now he owns his own team and is competeting at a very competitive level. His teams vary from 3 years old to 18 years old. I was movtivated to create this website for his team so that it could be easier for parents and team members to get any information missed from practices off the website. The website will also allow others looking for a team to learn more about this team and what they are about.
